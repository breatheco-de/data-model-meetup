## 📝Instructions

Your Job is to specify all the `tables`, `properties` and relationships in the diagram to replicate the Meetup.com Data Model.

- Your project must have a table `User` that will represent your blog users.
- Your blog users will be able to login and RSVP to particular events.
- The database should store the users reservations.
- The database should store all the events.
- What other tables do you think a blog like this might have?
- What properties should go inside the user? or inside the Event table? or any other table?
- What are the relationships between those tables?
- Please add at least 4 models with all of its properties.
